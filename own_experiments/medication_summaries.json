For instance, one patient mentioned, \"No side effects that I'm aware of\" in relation to Lisinopril. Another patient stated they were \"doing well\" on the medication, suggesting general compliance without noted side effects. Since there are mentions of high blood pressure concerns but no explicit negative effects mentioned, we conclude that side effects aren't highlighted in the consultations.",

For example, patients in the transcripts referred to using Lisinopril to manage their blood pressure: 'I was even as high as one seventy over ninety,' indicating monitoring and adjustments were required. Additionally, one physician advised a patient, 'I want to increase the lisinopril from 10 mg to 20 mg a day' to better control hypertension. Lisinopril was also part of the regimen for patients struggling with fluid retention due to congestive heart failure, as seen in the assessment of another patient, suggesting the medication's role in managing heart function and blood pressure.",
