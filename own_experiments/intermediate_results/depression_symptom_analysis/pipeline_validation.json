The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a \u201cnagging feeling\u201d when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.\n\nIn addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.\n\nThe patient\u2019s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient\u2019s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.\n\nThe patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nRespiratory\nLungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\n\nCardiovascular\nNo murmurs, gallops, or rubs.\n\nAbdomen\nNormoactive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants. There is mild left periumbilical tenderness to palpation, mild hepatomegaly, and increased stool burden in colon.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT of Abdomen, 01/23/2020.\nImpression: Normal CT of abdomen.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Constipation\n\u2022 Mild hepatomegaly\n\nPLAN\n\nPatrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago. The patient is currently on Crestor which may be contributing to his elevated liver enzymes. We discussed findings, diagnosis, and next steps at length.\n\nConstipation\n\u2022 Start daily fiber supplement and increase water consumption to at least 48 ounces daily to help with bowel regularity.\n\u2022 Avoid trigger foods that may cause episodes of diarrhea.\n\nMild Hepatomegaly\n\u2022 Repeat liver enzyme labs today.\n\u2022 Schedule a liver ultrasound pending lab results.\n\u2022 Encouraged to cease alcohol consumption.\n\u2022 Patient to contact his PCP to discuss alternative medications.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nReturn to clinic in 4 weeks.\n", "file":

antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound\n[doctor] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them\n[patient] okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the results you know we will take action as needed okay\n[doctor] okay that sounds good\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] my nurse will be in with those those orders\n[doctor] alright thank you\n[patient] alright thanks\n[doctor] bye", "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHepatitis C.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBruce Ward is a pleasant 60-year-old male who presents to the clinic today following a positive result in a hepatitis C antibody test. He was sent to obtain the hepatitis C antibody test as part of a routine physical. He states he is anxious with the results and denies he has ever been diagnosed with hepatitis C. The patient admits to intravenous drug use in the past; however, he notes it has been longer than 15 years since his last usage. He also reports a history of heavy alcohol use. He continues to drink a beer on occasion. The patient currently smokes 1 to 2 cigarettes per day. He notes he used to smoke more and is having difficulty with complete cessation.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient denies any significant past medical history.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient is married with children. He reports history of IV drug use 15 years ago. He currently drinks beer occasionally. The patient reports smoking 1 to 2 cigarettes per day.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nHe reports a family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient denies taking any current medications.\n\nVITALS\n\nAll vital signs are within normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL: In no apparent distress.\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm. Grade 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur is appreciated.\nRESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\nGI/GU: Abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly. Bowel sounds are present.\nSKIN: No jaundice.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe HCV antibody test was reviewed today and is positive.\n\nLiver panel revealed an elevated AST at 39 U/L. The ALT, albumin, and total bilirubin were all within normal limits.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nHepatitis C.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's laboratory findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him in regard to his current symptoms. His initial labs were consistent with a hepatitis C diagnosis. I have recommended that we confirm the diagnosis with additional blood work including checking his hepatitis C RNA and HCV genotype. I have also recommended that we obtain an ultrasound elastography to evaluate for fibrosis of the liver.\n\nThe patient is married with children and is concerned about their hepatitis C status. I advised the patient that his family should be screened and we will assist him with setting appointments with their primary care physician.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 3 weeks to review his results and discuss further treatment.", "file": "D2N038-aci", "depression_symptom": ["anxiety"], "evidence_of_depressive_symptoms": ["\"i'm doing okay but i'm a little bit anxious about having hep c\""], "list_of_dsm_criteria_fulfilled": ["1.

you're coming in and for evaluation of a newly diagnosed ovarian cancer so how are you doing today\n[patient] i do n't hear the question but i'm assuming that you when you say batcher so when i start talking about my dog and my three cats and all that those sort of things are not going to be included in the in the note\n[doctor] right i want you you can talk about those things yes\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay so with your newly diagnosed ovarian cancer so how are you feeling today how are you doing\n[patient] i'm doing pretty good depressed\n[doctor] little depressed i can understand it's a lot to take on is n't it\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay okay so lem me ask you some questions so what kind of symptoms were you having that prompted you your doctor to do the tests\n[patient] i was having severe pain and bleeding\n[doctor] okay now do you have other symptoms such as weight loss constipation vomiting or issues with urination\n[patient] no vomiting but constipation and weight loss\n[doctor] okay yeah that's understandable so do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant\n[patient] i'm sorry i did n't hear that part\n[doctor] do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant\n[patient] no to either one of those\n[doctor] okay so and do you know at what age you got your period and when you started menopause\n[patient] thirteen for my period and twenty eighth for menopause\n[doctor] okay do you take any oral hormone replacement therapy\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay any history of endometriosis\n[patient] any history of what\n[doctor] endometriosis\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay how about any family history of any gynecological cancers\n[patient] i was adopted\n[doctor] okay okay so i'm just gon na do a quick exam of your abdomen and then perform a vaginal exam okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright okay so i do feel the mass on the where to go here okay\n[patient] i did n't know you're gon na play a doctor today\n[doctor] i did okay okay so i do feel the mass on the left side but everything else looks good and on abdominal exam there is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant no rebounding or guarding on vaginal exam there are no external lesions on the labia the vaginal vault is within normal limits the cervix is pink without lesions and on bimanual exam i appreciate a left adnexal mass and there is no masses on the right okay so now i reviewed the results of your abdominal ct which show a three centimeter left ovarian mass with an associated local localized lymph node involvement there is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease so lem me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem so i do think this is most likely ovarian cancer looking at your ct scan it looks like stage three a disease based on the lymph node involvement i want to start by sending off some blood tests like a ca-125 and hcg and afp and ldh these are just tests that help me to determine what type of tumor i'm dealing with and then i want you to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if you have a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer so this stage of ovarian cancer is treated by performing surgery followed by adjunct chemotherapy so this means we'll start chemotherapy after you've recovered from surgery okay so for the surgery i would perform a hysterectomy remove both ovaries and perform a lymph node dissection to remove the involved and involve lymph nodes as well as any other ones i see and i'll also send a sample of any tissue if there anything that looks suspicious at all and we'll be able to tell exactly what stage this is based on the pathology reports i then recommend chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxol and based on how the surgery goes i may want you to receive intraperitoneal intraperitoneal chemo which is done inserting a small tube into your belly for the chemo to go directly into your peritoneum now i know that was a lot sick in do you have any questions or\n[patient] am i gon na die\n[doctor] well that's a good question so based on what i see at this time i will we believe you have a favorable diagnosis prognosis and you're also still young and healthy which makes your prognosis even better and we do need to see a final pathology report to give you a definitive answer though okay\n[patient]

Ovarian cancer.\n- Medical Reasoning: Looking at her abdominal CT results, it appears to be stage IIIA disease based on the lymph node involvement.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that the typical approach to treating this stage of cancer is surgical intervention followed by adjunct chemotherapy. The procedure and subsequent chemotherapy plans were discussed in detail. Given that she is young and otherwise healthy, I reassured her that I believe her prognosis is favorable based on her current status, however, this is dependent on the final pathology report. All of her questions were answered.\n- Medical Treatment: I want to start by ordering several blood tests including a CA-125, hCG, AFP, and LDH. I also want her to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if she has a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer. I recommend we perform a hysterectomy and oophorectomy, as well as a lymph node dissection to remove any involved lymph nodes. Any concerning tissue will be biopsied and sent to pathology for staging. After she has recovered from surgery, she will start chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin and Taxol. We may also consider intraperitoneal chemotherapy.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.", "file": "D2N046-aci", "depression_symptom": ["depressed", "severe pain", "bleeding", "constipation", "weight loss"], "evidence_of_depressive_symptoms": ["\"i'm doing pretty good depressed\"", "\"i was having severe pain and bleeding\"", "\"no vomiting but constipation and weight loss\""], "list_of_dsm_criteria_fulfilled": ["Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day", "Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain", "Fatigue or loss of energy"], "validated_symptoms": [{"symptom": "depressed", "verified": true, "reason": "The symptom 'depressed' is explicitly mentioned by the patient: 'i'm doing pretty good depressed'."}, {"symptom": "severe pain", "verified": true, "reason": "The symptom 'severe pain' is exactly stated by the patient: 'i was having severe pain and bleeding'."}, {"symptom": "bleeding", "verified": true, "reason": "The symptom 'bleeding' is explicitly mentioned in the quote: 'i was having severe pain and bleeding'."}, {"symptom": "constipation", "verified": true, "reason": "The symptom 'constipation' is clearly mentioned by the patient: 'no vomiting but constipation and weight loss'."}, {"symptom": "weight loss", "verified": true, "reason": "The symptom 'weight loss' is explicitly stated by the patient: 'no vomiting but constipation and weight loss'."}], "validated_evidence": [{"quote": "\"i'm doing pretty good depressed\"", "verified": true, "reason": "The quote is an exact match from the transcript."}, {"quote": "\"i was having severe pain and bleeding\"", "verified": true, "reason": "The quote matches the transcript exactly."}, {"quote": "\"no vomiting but constipation and weight loss\"", "verified": true, "reason": "The quote is an exact match from the transcript."}], "validation_summary": "All symptoms and evidence quotes have been validated as accurate and match the original transcript."}]
