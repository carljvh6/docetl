    prompt: |
      Analyze the following transcript of a conversation between a doctor and a patient:
      {{ input.src }}
      Extract and list all medications mentioned in the transcript.
      If no medications are mentioned, return an empty list.

    comparison_prompt: |
      Compare the following two medication entries:
      Entry 1: {{ input1.medication }}
      Entry 2: {{ input2.medication }}
      Are these medications likely to be the same or closely related?

      Given the following matched medication entries:
      {% for entry in inputs %}
      Entry {{ loop.index }}: {{ entry.medication }}
      {% endfor %}
      Determine the best resolved medication name for this group of entries. The resolved
      name should be a standardized, widely recognized medication name that best represents
      all matched entries.

      Here are some transcripts of conversations between a doctor and a patient:

      {% for value in inputs %}
      Transcript {{ loop.index }}:

      Ensure your summary:
      - Is based solely on information from the provided transcripts
      - Focuses only on {{ reduce_key }}, not other medications
      - Includes relevant details from all transcripts
      - Is clear and concise
